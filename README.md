# AutoGG ðŸ‘‹ 
AutoGG is a Minecraft Forge mod that automatically says "gg" after a game has ended on Hypixel. </br>
**Now with updated Triggers and 1.12 - 1.12.2 support!**

***Note as of 11/02/2022 - </br>
Yes, I know there's a build on 2pi's website for 1.12. </br>
At the time I was only learning how to port mods, and didn't happen to have noticed a build available at the time. </br>
I made this in May, 2020 (per my previous commits). I'm sure I'm breaking (a) license(s) here too. My apologies.***
